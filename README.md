## Problem

1. **Lack of users choice:** Users don't have a control over their assets, let it be ERC20, ERC721
2. **Difficulty in Onboarding:** Onboarding new developers to web3 can be difficult since they have to hop on to m,ultiple bridges/swap and see if they are getting the assets that they want
3. **Losing assets** Receiver might lose assets if the sender is sending wrong assets to wrong chain/addressess.
   



## Solution
Hence we have come up with a solution where in sender can send any asset from any chain to the user, our solution will look upon that the receiver receives the right asset on the right chain and their preferred address
